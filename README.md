Static HTML and CSS from a given mockup

In the framework of my studies of Web Development and Integration. We were prompted to build a static html page from a defined model.

The objectif was to do it identically of the model given.

For this achievement it was upon to us to use Flexbox or Grid layout.

In my exercice I tried both views finally using Grid Layout as the main view.
